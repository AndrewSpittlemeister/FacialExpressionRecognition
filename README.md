# FacialExpressionRecognition

- Using Kaggle's fer2013 data set.
- Using Keras with a tensorflow backend.
- Notebooks are executed in Google's Collaboratory Environment (Python3 with GPU support).

This project will consist of training and using convolutional neural networks to classify the facial expressions a human present in the input picture. Various levels of the network will represent the extraction of different features relevant to the problem; this feature data will be fed into a densely connected non-recurrent deep neural network to perform classification of the facial expression. The goal for this application is to be able to perform this classification in a near-real-time fashion. 


This is a work in progress...
