# Intermediate Layer Output

- Files in this directory show the intermediate output of various layers in the final model's network. These intermediate output images were all derived from the same input image.
- Additionally, there is an image showing all of the filters generated by the first convolutional layer. Following layer's filters quickly become too intractable to show.
